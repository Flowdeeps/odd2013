What is it?

"Nom und Schade" is a tool to see restaruants by rating and location in Berlin. It uses a demo subset of the non-freely available (only by request) data of official health and safety restaurant ratings in Charlottenburg and Wilmersdorf, Berlin.
It was created for the Open Data Day 2013 in Berlin.
